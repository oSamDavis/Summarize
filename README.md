## Project Title 

Abstractive Text Summarizarion Using Transformers

---

## Project Description

This project is Philander Smith College's submission for the Booz Allen Codefest Challenges.
In this project, we aim to generate a concise and meaningful summary of text from multiple text resources such as books, news articles and blog post.
We utilize transformers in order to streamline work and ensure accuracy. The transformer used in this project is a standard encoder-decoder transformer and is responsible for catching the relationship between all words which occur in the sentence.
The model used in this project is Pegasus. In the Pegasus model, important sentences are extracted from an input document and joined together as one output sequence from the remaining sentences.
